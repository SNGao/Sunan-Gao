	abstract = {Local regression is an old method for smoothing data, having origins in the graduation of mortality data and the smoothing of time series in the late 19th century and the early 20th century. Still, new work in local regression continues at a rapid pace. We review the history of local regression. We discuss four of its basic components that must be chosen in using local regression in practice — the weight function, the parametric family that is fitted locally, the bandwidth, and the assumptions about the distribution of the response. A major theme of the paper is that these choices represent a modeling of the data; different data sets deserve different choices. We describe polynomial mixing, a method for enlarging polynomial parametric families. We introduce an approach to adaptive fitting,assessment of parametric localization. We describe the use of this approach to design two adaptive procedures: one automatically chooses the mixing degree of mixing polynomials at each x using cross-validation, and the other chooses the bandwidth at each x using Cp. Finally, we comment on the efficacy of using asymptotics to provide guidance for methods of local regression.},

	abstract = {Analog sensors often require complex mathematical models for data analysis. Digital twins ({DTs}) provide platforms to display sensor data in real time but still lack generic solutions regarding how mathematical models and algorithms can be integrated. Based on previous tests for monitoring and predicting banana fruit quality along the cool chain, we demonstrate how a system of multiple models can be converted into a {DT}. Our new approach provides a set of generic “wrapper functions”, which largely simplify model integration. The wrappers connect the in- and outputs of models to the streaming platform and, thus, require only minor changes to the model software. Different scenarios for model linking structures are considered, including simultaneous processing of multiple models, sequential processing of life-cycle-specific models, and predictive models, based on data from the current and previous life cycles. The wrapper functions can be easily adapted to host models or microservices from various applications fields, to predict the future system behavior and to test what-if scenarios.},
